# paas

PAAS level runs our stateful systems like databases and messaging.
- nats
- tidb
- minio

## Packaging

For now just binaries of the stuff we need at the PAAS level.

Later docker and Helm go here and we can work out how to use core-fish and core-bs to deploy it off tags like we do for all binaries.
